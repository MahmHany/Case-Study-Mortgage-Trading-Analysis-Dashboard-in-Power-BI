<h2>Project Overview</h2>
As part of a comprehensive data analytics project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze mortgage trading activities, providing actionable insights for trade execution and profit optimization. This dashboard, titled "Case Study: Mortgage Trading," was designed to empower stakeholders with a clear understanding of loan statuses, trade execution details, and key factors influencing pricing and profitability.
<br />


<h2>Key Features</h2>

- <b>Loan Status Overview: The dashboard includes a detailed table summarizing loan statuses, such as "Closed - Ready to Trade," across a dataset of 146 loans. It tracks critical metrics like scheduled principal balance ($336,576,636.43 total) and weighted average (WA) price (103.45), enabling users to monitor the portfolio's health and readiness for trading.</b> 
- <b>Trade Execution Analysis: A breakdown of trade amounts and premiums by counterparty (e.g., Storgan Manley, Bank of Americans, Goldman Sachs, PJ Logan) is presented through intuitive bar charts. For instance, Storgan Manley accounted for $50.14B in trade amount, with a trade premium distribution of 24.8% (Bank of Americans) to 40.7% (PJ Logan), offering a clear view of counterparty performance.</b>
- <b>Key Influencers Analysis: Using Power BI's Key Influencers visual, I identified factors driving price increases in mortgage trades. The analysis revealed that a median FICO score below 760 increases the average price by 0.72, while a debt-to-income ratio above 0.17 contributes to a 0.41 increase. A histogram further illustrates that prices are more likely to rise when the median FICO score exceeds 760, with an average price of 103.34 in such cases.</b>


<h2>Technical Skills Demonstrated</h2>

- <b>Power BI Proficiency: Leveraged Power BI to create a visually appealing and functional dashboard, utilizing features like tables, bar charts, histograms, and key influencer visuals.</b>
- <b>Data Visualization: Designed clear and concise visuals to communicate complex financial data effectively to non-technical stakeholders.</b> 

- <b>Business Acumen: Focused on metrics critical to mortgage trading, such as WA price, trade premiums, and profit margins, to deliver business-relevant insights.</b>
  


<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

- <b>The "Case Study: Mortgage Trading Analysis Dashboard in Power BI" was likely developed as part of a data analytics initiative, possibly for a financial institution, a data analyst training program, or a portfolio project to demonstrate proficiency in business intelligence tools. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of its purpose:</b>
